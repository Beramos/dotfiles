# dotfiles

Locally, this is the central folder for all the "dotfiles".
The dotfiles are distributed through symbolic links to their respective folders.

## Initialisation
```bash
    bash initialise
```
This established the symbolic links to the proper locations.

## Terminal plugins
* [Oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
* [Marker](https://github.com/pindexis/marker)
